# ML
ML PREDICTIONS USING ALGORITHMS

This code is a Streamlit application that performs machine learning classification using various algorithms. Here's a breakdown of its main components and functionality:

Import statements:--------

 The code imports necessary libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, streamlit, and various scikit-learn modules for machine learning.

Main function: The entire application is wrapped in a main() function.

Page setup:-------------
 It sets up the Streamlit page with a title, subtitle, and an image.

Algorithm selection:---------
 Users can select from five different classification algorithms: KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

File upload:---------
 Users can upload a CSV file containing the dataset.

Data preprocessing:----------------------

The uploaded file is read into a pandas DataFrame.
'User ID' and 'Gender' columns are dropped.
The data is split into features (x) and target (y).
The data is split into training and testing sets.
Features are scaled using StandardScaler.

Model training and evaluation:---------------------
 When the user clicks the "generate" button:

The selected algorithm is trained on the training data.
Predictions are made on the test data.
Performance metrics (accuracy and classification report) are displayed.
Visualizations of the test and train data are shown using matplotlib scatter plots.
Algorithm-specific implementations: Each algorithm (KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest) has its own implementation section, but they follow a similar pattern of training, prediction, and evaluation.

Visualization: For each algorithm, two scatter plots are generated:

One for the test data
One for the train data These plots show the distribution of the data points and their classifications.
Main block: The script checks if it's being run as the main program and calls the 'main()' function if so.

This application allows users to upload their own dataset, choose a classification algorithm, and quickly see the performance and visualizations of the chosen model on their data. It's a user-friendly way to experiment with different machine learning algorithms and compare their performance.
